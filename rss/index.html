All of my posts that were previously hosted on my old server will eventually updated and moved into this blogroll. I look forward to spending less time on maintenace of the servers outside of my office hours and just focus on my personal things when I am away from the office. The technical nature of the blog shouldn't change too much as I have moved on to much more interesting things in the last few months since my last post.</p>

<p>Recently my wife and I got a new dog, Cooper. He is a mutt with mostly Wheaton Terrier and Wiredhaired Pointing Griffon. We are enjoying our time with him tremendously now.</p>]]></description><link>http://david-rancourt.com/2014/10/22/moving-my-blog-to-github-pages/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">8e953f58-d3c2-4067-9ad3-8edd5a9d451d</guid><category><![CDATA[ghost]]></category><category><![CDATA[github-pages]]></category><category><![CDATA[buster]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[David Rancourt]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2014 03:39:41 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
